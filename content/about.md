Hi! I'm Ronit Kapoor, a first-year Master's student in Computer Science at Brown University, specializing in Machine Learning optimization techniques. I graduated with High Distinction from Worcester Polytechnic Institute with a 3.95 GPA, and I'm passionate about advancing the field of AI through research and practical applications.

## Background
I'm currently pursuing my Sc.M. in Computer Science at Brown University, where I'm conducting thesis research in machine learning. My academic foundation was built at WPI, where I was active in the Computer Science Honor Society (Upsilon Pi Epsilon) and served as a Student Assistant for the Data Mining course.
My research interests span across multiple areas of machine learning, from transformer architectures and high-performance computing optimization. I'm particularly drawn to the intersection of theoretical ML research and real-world applications. This would include deploy models on edge robotics.

## Research & Experience
Currently, I'm working as a researcher in High-Performance Computing, focusing on optimizing scientific workflows on HPC clusters. This work has resulted in significant improvements - achieving a 17% reduction in energy usage and 14% reduction in execution time across supercomputer systems. We're aiming to publish our findings at IPDPS.
I've had the privilege of working at some exceptional organizations:

MIT Lincoln Laboratories - (CLASSIFIED)
CloudBees - Developing agentic workflows for automated test case generation (supervised by Jenkins creator Kohsuke Kawaguchi)
ASSISTments - Enhancing LLM inference speed for educational feedback systems
Boston Scientific - Quality systems engineering for medical devices


## Goals
I'm planning to pursue a PhD after completing my Master's degree. I'm excited about contributing to the advancement of machine learning through both theoretical research and practical applications that can make a real impact.

## Interests
I'm making this website so that I can have a portfolio for any side projects that I work on.
